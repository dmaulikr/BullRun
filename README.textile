h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name, portrait, mode,
and original strength show up in the info box.

Units are configured in units.plist.

Map geometry, terrain data, and terrain effects are read from map.plist.  (Terrain can be verified only through the log window.)

You can click the [USA] and [CSA] buttons to switch sides, and the sighting works correctly.

You can drag out orders for units; the line is in the unit's color. Backing up works.  Double tapping cancels
current orders.  Orders for other units show up, dimmed.  Order lines have arrow heads.

Added drop shadows to the units.

Mode menu button shows up and actually sets the unit's mode.

Info box can be swapped between upper right and lower left corners.

CSA,USA Zones are embedded in map data

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map
* App Icons
* Unit Icons
* Attack animations (smoke?)
* Portraits for Militia + Volunteers

h3. Functionality
* Touching outside hex area should show status bar

h3. Organization
* Differentiate between BR-specific files (Terrain, BullRun.h) and Battle@ framework files (Board, Game, Unit)
* Board => HexMap
* add "friend" and "enemies" as methods in OrderOfBattle, use in Game#sighting
* probably should have a controller for InfoBarView

h3. Bugs
* Must guard against user dragging fast enough that move orders end up with non-adjacent hexes
* Trying to enter an impossible hex lets unit accumulate a crazy number of MPs
* It's possible to set a unit's mode to -1, which crashes
