h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name and original strength
show up in the info box.

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map
* Portraits; what size?

h3. Functionality
* Make info box draggable (or just shiftable from corner to corner?)
* Hook up remaining Info box fields
* Retain selected unit in MapViewController so can drag out orders
* Mode menu for units

h3. Organization
* Rearrange files
* OOB should be read from configuration file instead of hard-wired

h1. Notes

MapViewController.xib looks odd in XCode, but works fine in the simulator, because a coordinate transform is being used.
