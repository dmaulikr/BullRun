h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name, portrait, mode,
and original strength show up in the info box.

Units are configured in units.plist.

Map geometry and terrain is read from map.plist.  (Terrain can be verified only through the log window.)

You can click the [USA] and [CSA] buttons to switch sides, and the sighting works correctly.

You can drag out orders for units; the line is in the unit's color. Backing up works.

Added drop shadows to the units.

Mode menu button shows up and actually sets the unit's mode.

Info box can be swapped between upper right and lower left corners.

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map
* Unit Icons
* Attack animations (smoke?)

h3. Functionality
* Movement lines need an arrow head
* Movement orders for units
** doubleTap - cancel orders for unit
* Touching outside hex area should show status bar

h3. Organization
* Differentiate between BR-specific files (Terrain, BullRun.h) and Battle@ framework files (Board, Game, Unit)
* Board => HexMap
* add "friend" and "enemies" as methods in OrderOfBattle, use in Game#sighting
* probably should have a controller for InfoBarView
