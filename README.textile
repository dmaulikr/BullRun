h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name and original strength
show up in the info box.

Units are configured in units.plist.

Map geometry and terrain is read from map.plist.  Terrain can be verified only through the log window.

You can click the [USA] and [CSA] buttons to switch sides, and the sighting works correctly

You can drag out orders for units. Backing up works.

Added drop shadows to the units.

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map
* Portraits; what size?

h3. Functionality
* Info box is no longer in corner of window
* Info box "Bull Run" label is off-kilter when no unit selected
* Make info box draggable (or just shiftable from corner to corner?)
* Hook up remaining Info box fields
* Mode menu for units
* Movement orders for units
** doubleTap - cancel orders for unit

h3. Organization
* Differentiate between BR-specific files (Terrain, BullRun.h) and Battle@ framework files (Board, Game, Unit)
* Board => HexMap
* add "friend" and "enemies" as methods in OrderOfBattle, use in Game#sighting

h1. Notes

MapViewController.xib looks odd in XCode, but works fine in the simulator, because a coordinate transform is being used.
