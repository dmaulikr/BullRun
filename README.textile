h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name, portrait, mode,
and original strength show up in the info box.

Units are configured in units.plist.

Map geometry, terrain data, and terrain effects are read from map.plist.  (Terrain can be verified only through the log window.)

You can click the [USA] and [CSA] buttons to switch sides, and the sighting works correctly.

You can drag out orders for units; the line is in the unit's color. Backing up works.  Double tapping cancels
current orders.

Added drop shadows to the units.

Mode menu button shows up and actually sets the unit's mode.

Info box can be swapped between upper right and lower left corners.

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map
* App Icons
* Unit Icons
* Attack animations (smoke?)

h3. Functionality
* Movement lines need an arrow head
* Touching outside hex area should show status bar
* Must guard against user dragging fast enough that move orders end up with non-adjacent hexes
* Board "Zones" would be useful (for free setup, for example).  Organize as NSArray of columns, each column is an NSArray
of row ranges (1-3),(7-10).  Save/load as part of Board serialization.  Board will have NSDictionary of them; zone names
are the keys.

h3. Organization
* Differentiate between BR-specific files (Terrain, BullRun.h) and Battle@ framework files (Board, Game, Unit)
* Board => HexMap
* add "friend" and "enemies" as methods in OrderOfBattle, use in Game#sighting
* probably should have a controller for InfoBarView
