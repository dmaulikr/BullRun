h1. Current State

Unit lookup data is complete; you can tap on a square and the unit's name and original strength
show up in the info box.

h1. To Do

h3. UI/Art
* Real map

h3. Functionality
* Make info box draggable (or just shiftable from corner to corner?)
* Make units visible
* Hook up remaining Info box fields
* Try animating Info box changes
* Blank out info box when tapping on squares with no unit
* Retain selected unit in MapViewController

h3. Organization
* Rearrange files

h1. Notes

MapViewController.xib looks odd in XCode, but works fine in the simulator, because a coordinate transform is being used.
